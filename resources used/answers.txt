to check dns resolution: watch -n 1 'nslookup -type=any cisco.com' but it's not catching in my route 53 :(
to monitor ---> check gif file in this folder.
Despite I have security rule the VPC is not opening port 22 :( (should review)

Instructions to launch and connect through SSH to the machine.

go to provider.tf and insert your keys or your AWS service account (in my computer the pem key didn't worked)

1 create with putty or other tool a ssh.priv key and pub key
2 copy it in your folder and link it in var.tf (public_key_path default value)
3 after launching the terraform script you will get the instance IP, copy it and go to putty (windows).
4 in putty write the ip and select the private key. use the user ec2-user et voil√†.
