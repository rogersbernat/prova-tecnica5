Day 2: 

Not much time, tomorrow I have a presentation with my rundeck project so I priorized this first.

        Created vpc in Ireland with Terraform and played a bit with EC2 Instances (So damn slow booting comparated with GCP!)
        The concepts of vpc and networking are different, in GCP they use the Metadata Service (in GCP you can't touch DNS in the instance or you loose ssh connectivity!)

        So Far I reproduced the environment to automate with Terraform and made a 'shoplist' of things I have to not forget when writting the terraform template.
